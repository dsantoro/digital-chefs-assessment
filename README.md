# Digital Chefs Assessment

I preferred to keep everything very simple, using pure CSS and abusing caching by choosing the React Query tool.

## Instalation

This app is powered by Vite JS and run it is pretty straightforward:

```bash
   npm run dev
```

By default it will running on port 5173

You can see a deployed running version [here](https://digital-chefs-assessment.vercel.app/)
